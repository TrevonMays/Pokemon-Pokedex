# Hello Everyone 

This was my first project I done using Api's. I choosed to use Pokemon becasue it is one of my favorite childhood cartoon.

For technical purposes I wanted to know how to use vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS display all togther while using grabbing data from a api.

To use the app simply type in a pokemon name and click the search.

The 2 images are the Pokemon I chosen to display.
